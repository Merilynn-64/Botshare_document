## Our solution  
This initiative comprised of two parts: **[Level_1: Incubation](L1_Incubation/)** and **[Level_2 Acceleraion](L2_Acceleration/)**. First part is a set of PVC educational DIY kits and second part is based on **two open-source real-world projects** that merge **AI-driven automation with practical robotics training**:  
- **[OpenAMR](https://github.com/openAMRobot)** – Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for warehouse logistics and material handling.  
- **EasyMove** – AI-powered, puzzle-based rack-moving systems for smart storage and sorting (in progress...).  

By integrating **AMRs with intelligent storage solutions**, we provide an **affordable, scalable, and flexible** warehouse automation framework while **training professionals in deep-tech disciplines** to drive innovation in robotics and AI.  

## Who benefits?  
This program is designed for a wide range of participants, including:  

- **Aspiring Robotics & AI engineers** – Seamless learning path from school-level STEM to professional robotics and AI development.
- **Engineers & Tech professionals** – Gain expertise in robotics, AI, and industrial automation.
