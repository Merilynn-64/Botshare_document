# Thank You for Supporting Botshare Book 💙

At Botshare Book, we believe that practical, hands-on knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone — regardless of location, background, or financial means. Your support helps us turn this belief into reality. Every line of code we write, every page of content we build, and every lesson we structure is fueled by a vision of empowering the next generation of makers, thinkers, and innovators. When you choose to support us, you’re not just donating — you're becoming part of a movement to democratize robotics and automation education.

Your contributions are used diligently and with purpose. Whether it's maintaining our open-source documentation platform, designing structured learning paths, or integrating tools that make the learning experience smoother and more dynamic, your support directly shapes the quality and reach of our work. We don’t spend on fluff. Instead, we prioritize what truly matters: building an ecosystem where students, educators, and hobbyists alike can learn real-world skills that matter in today’s evolving tech landscape. You make it possible for us to keep everything open, transparent, and continuously improving.

We are not a large organization with a marketing team and big sponsors. We’re a passionate, small team of builders, learners, and volunteers who work late nights and weekends to make this platform meaningful and relevant. Every donation — whether it's $1 or $100 — sends us a clear message: someone believes in what we’re doing. And that belief is what keeps us going. It helps us improve the user interface, add deeper explanations, respond to feedback, and deliver real educational value to people across the world. You are not just funding a project. You are investing in people’s growth and in a platform that grows with them.

We’re beyond grateful for your trust. And we commit to honoring that trust with transparency, dedication, and steady progress. Whether you’re a student learning automation, a teacher using our resources in class, or a curious explorer browsing our pages — you matter. This platform exists because of people like you. And with your continued support, we will keep building — one contribution at a time.
