## Core pillars  
Training is structured around four interconnected areas:  
1. **Deep-Tech & Robotics** – AI-robotics education, both theoretical and practical.  
2. **Hands-On Development** – Prototyping AMRs, cobots, and AI-powered automation systems.  
3. **Prototyping & Manufacturing** – Transitioning concepts into real-world production.  
4. **Business & Entrepreneurship** – Turning robotics innovations into scalable commercial ventures.
