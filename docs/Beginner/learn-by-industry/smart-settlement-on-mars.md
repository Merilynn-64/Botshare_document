# Smart Settlement on Mars: Off-World Automation and Habitat Control

This visionary lesson challenges students to design and prototype **autonomous systems for a future Mars habitat**. Using Arduino-compatible microcontrollers and real-world sensors, students simulate how humans could survive and thrive in extreme extraterrestrial environments.

The project integrates **robotics, life-support control, environmental sensing, and automation** — pushing students to apply engineering and creativity to one of the most ambitious challenges: building a smart, self-sustaining Martian colony.

## How It Works

1. Environmental sensors monitor internal "Mars habitat" conditions such as air quality, pressure, and temperature.  
2. Automated systems like airlock doors and ventilation fans respond to sensor input to simulate pressure stabilization.  
3. LED and solar modules simulate power control and light cycles for hydroponic growth chambers.  
4. A Mars rover simulation uses motors, ultrasonic sensors, and LIDAR to explore terrain, detect obstacles, and map paths.  
5. The ESP32-CAM sends video data to a remote dashboard, allowing live monitoring of habitat systems from a browser interface.

Students build the system step-by-step and test it as if they were engineers managing a base on another planet.
