# Smart Greenhouse Automation (Arduino-Based)

In this hands-on lesson, students design, prototype, and deploy a fully automated smart greenhouse system using Arduino microcontrollers, IoT sensors, and wireless modules. The project simulates a modern farming environment where technology optimizes crop yield while conserving natural resources.

Students explore how AI and IoT systems work together to monitor and regulate the growing environment. By the end of the lesson, learners gain practical insight into smart agriculture and sustainable design.
