# Smart Factory: Robotic Arm and Vision-Guided Sorting Conveyor

In this lesson, students explore the core concepts of **industrial automation** by building a mini smart factory cell. Using Arduino, sensors, cameras, and robotic components, they create a working model of a **vision-guided sorting system** — similar to the ones used in modern factories like Amazon or Tesla.

The project focuses on **detecting, identifying, and sorting objects automatically** based on color or shape, combining robotics, computer vision, and smart control systems.

## How It Works

1. **Objects are placed** on the moving conveyor.  
2. **A sensor or camera** detects the object and identifies its color or shape.  
3. **The microcontroller processes** this information and decides which bin the object should go to.  
4. The **robotic arm or servo system** moves the object to the correct bin.  
5. The system **repeats the process**, fully automated.

This setup mimics smart manufacturing environments where speed, accuracy, and automation are essential.
