# Smart Home and IoT Automation Lab

In this hands-on lesson, students design and build a prototype of a **smart home** system. They integrate sensors, Wi-Fi modules, and control logic to create an environment that is intelligent, responsive, and energy-efficient. The project mimics modern smart homes that support features like motion-triggered lighting, remote monitoring, and voice-controlled appliances.

Through this lab, students explore the growing field of **home automation and IoT integration**, focusing on real-world applications in security, comfort, and energy savings.

## Components Used

| Component                          | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| PIR Motion Sensor + Reed Switch   | Detect motion and door status (security monitoring)       |
| DHT11 / DHT22                     | Monitor temperature and humidity for climate control      |
| Relay Modules                     | Switch lights, fans, heaters, and other appliances        |
| IR Sensors + RF Modules           | Control legacy appliances wirelessly                      |
| ESP8266 (NodeMCU)                 | Act as Wi-Fi enabled smart hub for data/control           |
| Google Assistant / Alexa via IFTTT| Enable voice commands for lights, fans, etc.              |
| OLED Display                      | Display status information locally                        |
| Web Dashboard (Blynk / Firebase)  | Monitor and control the system remotely                   |
| Light-dependent Resistor (LDR)    | Enable auto-lighting based on ambient daylight levels     |

## How It Works

1. Sensors detect temperature, humidity, motion, and lighting conditions in the environment.  
2. The microcontroller processes sensor data and controls appliances (e.g., lights, fans) using relays.  
3. The system sends data to the cloud using Wi-Fi and displays live stats on a dashboard or OLED screen.  
4. Voice assistants (Google or Alexa) are connected through IFTTT for voice-based control of devices.  
5. Security features use motion and door sensors to simulate smart alerts or alarms.

This setup models an intelligent home where devices interact seamlessly and adapt to user needs.
