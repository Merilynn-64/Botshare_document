# Level 1: Incubation

The incubation program introduces students of any age (min 8 y.o.) to **AI, robotics, and automation** through hands-on projects using **mBlock** and **Blockly**. The curriculum covers **AI & robotics fundamentals, smart home automation, face and voice recognition, IoT, and AI-powered navigation**, transitioning from **block-based coding to Python & C++**.

_Students will build **DIY educational kits** using **CNC-milled plastic and vacuum forming**, making manufacturing part of the learning process._

Projects include **AI-driven robots, smart home assistants, industrial automation, neurotechnology (e.g., worm's digital neural system), defense, and aerospace applications**, fostering **problem-solving, critical thinking, and future-ready STEM skills**
