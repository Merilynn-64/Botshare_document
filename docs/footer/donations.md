# **Support OpenAMRobot**  
**Understand Why Your Support Is Important**  
OpenAMRobot is an open-source project run by the community that aims to create inexpensive autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for use in education, research, and hands-on learning.  
We focus on practical robotics by employing real-world hardware, academic research-based documentation, and an open technology mentality that is welcoming to anyone.

To keep this project moving ahead and up to date, we need to keep working on it.  
We can keep doing the following:  
- Make better documentation and teaching materials for schools, universities, and makers  
- Keep the robot's hardware and software stack up to date and improve it  
- Add new features and ensure repeatable testing environments  
- Engage the community and help new contributors get started  
- Make robotics more accessible for under-resourced learners
