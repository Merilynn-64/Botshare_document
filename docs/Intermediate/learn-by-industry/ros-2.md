# ROS 2 Software Stack for Autonomous Navigation

This core software lesson guides students through building the **"brain" of an autonomous mobile robot (AMR)** using the **ROS 2 framework**. Students implement key autonomy modules such as localization, mapping, and path planning using open-source ROS 2 packages. The final result is a fully integrated navigation system capable of moving through unknown environments safely and intelligently.

## Core Concepts

- Configuring and tuning the **Navigation2 (Nav2) stack**  
- Implementing **odometry**, **TF tree broadcasting**, and **localization** with AMCL  
- Performing **mapping and SLAM** using tools like `slam_toolbox` or `cartographer`  
- Setting up **sensor drivers** (e.g., LIDAR, IMU, encoders) and robot model (URDF/Xacro)  
- Developing and launching **ROS 2 nodes** in Python or C++  
- Performing **simulation testing** in **Gazebo** and **RViz**

## System Overview

1. The robot’s physical model is described using **URDF** or **Xacro**, including joints, wheels, and sensors.  
2. **Sensor drivers** are launched to stream real-time data from LIDARs, IMUs, and wheel encoders.  
3. **Odometry** and **TF frames** are published, forming the basis of robot localization.  
4. The **AMCL** node is used for localization against a map, or **SLAM** is used for building maps dynamically.  
5. The **Nav2 stack** plans paths, avoids obstacles, and sends velocity commands to the base controller.  
6. Simulation and visualization are conducted using **Gazebo** and **RViz**, with testing routines and tuning cycles.

## Learning Outcomes

- Set up and configure a **modular ROS 2 software stack**  
- Develop and launch **ROS 2 nodes** in both Python and C++  
- Build real-time localization and mapping pipelines  
- Understand and manipulate the **TF2 tree** and ROS message types  
- Integrate and test robot software in **simulated environments**  
- Gain practical skills in the **ROS 2 development workflow**

---

## Optional Extensions

- Replace AMCL with **EKF-based localization** using robot_localization package  
- Use **Nav2 Behavior Tree customization** to define custom navigation logic  
- Add **multi-robot simulation scenarios** in Gazebo  
- Deploy and benchmark on a physical robot for real-world tuning  
- Create a **teleoperation or diagnostic GUI** for remote mission support
