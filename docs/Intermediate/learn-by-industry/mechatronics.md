# Mechatronics and Hardware Integration

This lesson focuses on the **design and control of mechatronic subsystems** for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). Students explore the integration of motors, sensors, microcontrollers, and embedded control software — forming the mechanical and electronic foundation of an intelligent robot.

Students work with **real-time embedded systems** and learn how hardware-level decisions impact performance, safety, and reliability in mobile robotics platforms.

## System Overview

1. The robot’s motion is controlled by a **differential-drive system** using DC motors and precision encoders.  
2. A **Teensy 4.1** microcontroller processes encoder feedback, performs odometry calculations, and controls the motor driver using PWM signals.  
3. The system includes **voltage monitoring** and **current sensing** for battery safety and energy diagnostics.  
4. Communication with a higher-level ROS-based master is done using **Micro-ROS**, enabling command and telemetry exchange over serial or UDP.
