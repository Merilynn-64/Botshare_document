# Autonomous Warehouse Task Simulation & CV-Based Docking

This applied robotics lesson focuses on simulating an **AI-powered mobile robot** performing logistics tasks in a warehouse environment. Students implement **computer vision-based docking**, waypoint navigation, and task execution using the ROS 2 framework and modern perception tools.

By combining **vision**, **navigation**, and **behavioral planning**, this lesson mirrors the systems used in real-world automated warehouses operated by companies like Amazon, DHL, and various robotics startups.

## Technologies Covered

- **AprilTag** or **ArUco marker detection** using OpenCV  
- **Pose estimation** and alignment logic for precision docking  
- Task-based navigation using **waypoints** and **behavior trees** (BTs)  
- Integrating **computer vision feedback** into ROS 2 control loops

---

## System Overview

1. **Visual tags** (AprilTag or ArUco) are placed on docking stations or loading areas.  
2. A camera onboard the robot detects the tags and estimates their **relative pose** (position and orientation).  
3. The robot uses this pose information to **align and dock** accurately for task execution (e.g., loading/unloading).  
4. **Navigation goals** are organized using waypoints or behavior trees for multi-step tasks.  
5. ROS 2 nodes process vision input and issue movement commands via the Nav2 stack or direct velocity control.

## Learning Outcomes

- Detect and localize fiducial markers using OpenCV and ROS-compatible libraries  
- Calculate **pose transforms** and apply them for autonomous docking  
- Develop structured task flows using **waypoints** and **behavior trees**  
- Integrate **computer vision feedback** into the robotâ€™s navigation logic  
- Simulate real warehouse automation workflows using **ROS 2 and Gazebo**

---

## Optional Extensions

- Replace static markers with **dynamic QR codes** for multi-target environments  
- Use a **depth camera** (e.g., RealSense or ZED) for obstacle-aware docking  
- Integrate **voice or GUI interfaces** for assigning warehouse tasks  
- Log task completions and docking metrics to a **cloud-based dashboard**  
- Simulate **multi-robot coordination** and shared docking stations
